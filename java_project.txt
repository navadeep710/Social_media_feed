4. Creating a Mini Social Network Feed Using Trees and Graphs
Description: A social networking platform implementation focusing on relationship management and content distribution using graph structures.

Data Structures Used:

Graphs: For representing user relationships and connections
Trees: For comment hierarchies and content organization
Priority Queues: For feed ranking algorithms
Hash Maps: For user profile quick access
Algorithms Implemented:

Graph Traversal: BFS for finding shortest connection paths, DFS for community detection
Minimum Spanning Tree: For finding optimal connection suggestions
Topological Sorting: For timeline organization
Shortest Path: For mutual friend discovery
Synopsis: The platform models users as graph nodes with friendships as edges. Content feeds use tree structures for organizing posts and comments hierarchically. BFS finds shortest paths between users for friend suggestions, while DFS detects user communities. The feed ranking system uses priority queues to show relevant content based on engagement metrics.

Key Features:

User relationship mapping and management
Hierarchical comment systems
Friend suggestion algorithms
Community detection and grouping
Personalized feed generation with ranking
